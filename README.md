Game I'm working on... That's it.

If you want to download and try it out, first download [Zig](https://ziglang.org/download/) and add it to your path

Then run `zig build run` in the same directory as the `build.zig` file to run it
you should also be able to find the executable in `zig-out/bin` afterwards, make sure it's moved to the same directory as assets or else it'll crash
